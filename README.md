###CSS3 Animations

In our first assignment, we had to make a couple of animations with CSS3 transforms and keyframes. 

The first part is with the CSS3 transform property and some translateX or Y.
The second part is with keyframes.

<i>What have I learned?</i> <br />
How to make animations with CSS3(transform and keyframes) and how to optimize them for mobile devices.

###Advanced Javascript (Todo app)

We had to make a todo list in JS and we had to work with prototyping in JS. At first I had to get used to it because I'm used to working with classes(PHP, AS3/Flex). We also had to write the selector ability from jQuery(just so we understand how it works).

In the todo app, you are able to mark things as done and there are different priorities(high, medium, low).
