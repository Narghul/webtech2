###CSS3 Animations

In our first assignment, we had to make a couple of animations with CSS3 transforms and keyframes. 

The first part is with the CSS3 transform property and some translateX or Y.
The second part is with keyframes.

How to make animations with CSS3(transform and keyframes) and how to optimize them for mobile devices.

###Advanced Javascript (Todo app)

We had to make a todo list in JS and we had to work with prototyping in JS. At first I had to get used to it because I'm used to working with classes(PHP, AS3/Flex). We also had to write the selector ability from jQuery(just so we understand how it works).

In the todo app, you are able to mark things as done and there are different priorities(high, medium, low).

###Weather app

We had to make a weather app in JS. I worked with the Forecast.io API to fetch weather information and I used Google Maps API to fetch the location. For some reason the Forecast api doesn't store the location so I used Google Maps for that.
I also used Fastclick(to remove the 300ms delay for touch events), PACE progress bars to show that the app is loading and Skycons as the weather icons. Bootstrap is used to make it responsive.
